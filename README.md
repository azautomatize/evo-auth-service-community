## About

**Evo CRM Auth Service** is the authentication and authorization microservice of the Evo CRM Community. Built on Ruby on Rails 7.1, it provides Bearer token authentication, OAuth 2.0 (Doorkeeper), Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP, Email OTP, backup codes), Role-Based Access Control with simple `account_owner` / `agent` roles, and LGPD-compliant audit logging.

## Part of the Evo CRM Community

Evo CRM Auth Service is part of the [Evo CRM Community](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community) ecosystem maintained by Evolution Foundation. To use the full stack, clone the umbrella repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community.git
```

The Community Edition is **single-tenant** by design — one account, no multi-tenancy overhead, no super-admin, no billing or plans. The role hierarchy is simple: `account_owner` and `agent`.

---

## Features

### Authentication
- Bearer token authentication with JWT
- OAuth 2.0 provider via Doorkeeper (RFC 6749)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP, Email OTP, backup codes)
- Legacy DeviseTokenAuth support for backward compatibility
- Well-Known discovery endpoints (RFC 8414)

### Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): `account_owner` and `agent`
- Token rotation and secure session management

### Compliance
- LGPD-compliant data privacy controls
- Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions
- Database-driven feature flags

### API
- RESTful API with documented endpoints
- OpenAPI / Swagger documentation
- Webhook support for real-time notifications
- Multi-language support (EN, PT-BR)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** 3.4.4
- **Rails** 7.1+
- **PostgreSQL** 12+
- **Redis** 6+

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evo-auth-service-community.git
cd evo-auth-service-community

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Configure database
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

# Start server
rails server -p 3001
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

> **Default credentials**: configured in `db/seeds.rb`. Review and change them before any deployment.

### API documentation

Once running, Swagger UI is available at:

```
http://localhost:3001/api-docs
```

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/evo_auth_service_development

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1

# JWT secret
DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# OAuth
DOORKEEPER_SECRET_KEY=your_doorkeeper_secret_key

# Frontend URL (CORS and OAuth callbacks)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (MFA and notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

See `.env.example` for all available variables.

## Authentication examples

### Bearer token — interactive sessions only

```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'

# Use the token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**One session per user — on the Bearer axis.** Signing in revokes every
Doorkeeper Bearer token that user still holds; `data.revoked_sessions` in the
response says how many of them were still live (refreshable). The displaced token answers `401 INVALID_TOKEN` /
`Token has been revoked` on its next request. This is deliberate: a leaked
Bearer token dies at the next sign-in.

**What the sweep does not reach:** the legacy `devise_token_auth` session
issued by `POST /auth/sign_in` — with email and password, or with the SSO token
that completes a social login. It lives in `users.tokens`, is not a Bearer
token, and survives a Doorkeeper sign-in. "One session per user" is a statement
about Bearer tokens, not about every credential this service issues.

**Do not use login for a server-to-server integration.** Two processes that
authenticate this way as the same user revoke each other on every cycle, and
they also kick out that user's browser. Use an API access token (below).

`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` **consumes the credential it is given** and returns
a new one: the refresh token from the `_evo_rt` cookie, or — when the cookie is
not available, which is why the fallback exists — the access token in the
`Authorization` header. Either way the caller must store the token that comes
back. Calling refresh and discarding the answer ends the session.


### API access token (server-to-server)

This is the credential for integrations. It is not a Doorkeeper token: signing
in does not revoke it, and it has no refresh cycle.


```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users \
  -H "Api-Access-Token: YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

Mind the spelling: `Api-Access-Token`, with hyphens. nginx drops headers whose
names contain underscores unless `underscores_in_headers` is on, so
`api_access_token` can vanish before it reaches the app.

### OAuth 2.0 Bearer token (third-party apps)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

## Architecture

The auth service issues tokens consumed by all other services in the Evo CRM Community ecosystem:

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
                    │  Evo CRM Auth Service    │ ← (you are here)
                    │  (token issuance, RBAC)  │
                    └────────────┬─────────────┘
                                 │ Bearer token
          ┌──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┐
          ↓                      ↓                      ↓
   evo-ai-crm-community  evo-ai-core-service   evo-ai-processor
   (conversations,       (agents, tools,       (agent execution,
    contacts)             API keys, folders)    sessions)
```

Inter-service communication uses Bearer token authentication. Tokens issued by this service are forwarded between services — no `account-id` header required.
